What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
a.git folder is created, and git starts to track all the changes in our repo and saves it in the new rep.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area enable the user to commit defferent files in deifferent commits, and by that to seperate different changes between commits.
